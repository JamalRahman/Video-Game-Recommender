# Find a Game!
## Video game recommendation powered by the Steam platform
---

This project is a content-based filtering approach to video game recommendation & exploration, revolving around a core ML-Engine Flask application, and API for model deployment.

The project uses Doc2Vec and TFIDF word embeddings to map each product within the genre space

Roadmap:

Development version experiments with KD Tree Nearest Neighbour search for content based recommendation of TFIDF-tag embeddings

Embed TFIDF-tags in mid-sized dimension space and use cosine similarity

A small collaborative-filtering data set was found, we will investigate this avenue!
